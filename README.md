NEVER PUSH TO MASTER(EVER).
Double and triple check your code.
Make a new branch in your CLI.
Before pushing to your branch, make sure to "git pull" to eliminate unneccessary merge conflicts.
git pull
git status - to check what i did and changed.
git add . - to add all the files i made/changed.
git commit -m "" - to commit my changes with a message describing those changes.
git push -u origin - to push my changes to the github repo.
Go to git hub and create pull request.
When done with a task go to trello and move your task to the pending approval card so Erik can approve or request changes to it.
Mark it complete(green) on trello.
Go to the github link to make a pull request.
MAKE COMMIT MESSAGES VERY DETAILED. (Include every import)
